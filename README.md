**Overview:** 


This project is an example of a machine learning regression models in action. It uses the ML5  CharRNN library to creatively suggest poetry in the style of Emily Dickinson, T S Eliot and William Shakespeare.

    This is my letter to the world,
       That never wrote to me, --
    The simple news that Nature told,
       With tender majesty.

    Her message is committed
       To hands I cannot see;
    For love of her, sweet countrymen,
       Judge tenderly of me!


##  About / Tutorial: Training a model using CharRNN

- [x] Develop an environment.

    Training a model with the CharRNN library requires access to tensorflow, which in turn requires some pretty simple Python scripting. The instructions for how to do this can also be found in the [github for the CharRNN library](). 
    
    Be sure to use Python 3.6 as per the instructions. 

    To prepare the environnment:

    Check which versions of Python you have using 

    `$ python --version`

    You might need to download Python 3.6 for your OS.

       
   Also ensure that you have installed `pip`, which is the package manager for Python.

   We are going to use `pip` and `python 3.6` to set up a virtual environment on our machine, so that it does not interfere with any local Python on our machine.

   I used [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to set up my Python virtual environment, but `venv` should also work.

   To install virtualenv open the console and use

   `pip install virtualenv`

   Once we have virtualenv, we can create an environment using 

   `virtualenv -p python3.6 YOUR_ENV_NAME_HERE`

   It doesn't really matter where you create your environment, but you might like to keep it seperate from any final projects (like a front-end to dispaly the output), as you will be cloning a repo into this environment. You can copy the models produced in this environment easily. 

   The environment is now created. 

   We have to activate this new environment with

    `source YOUR_ENV_NAME_HERE/bin/activate`
    
   You should now see that your terminal is in a new Python sub terminal, and your machine is ready to learn.
     

- [x] Train the model using the text files.

   I used [this](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242) version of Emily Dickinson's complete poems and created a new txt file, with everything but the poems removed.

   Check the size of your file--you want as much data as possible (but your training might take a while).

   The next set of instructions are as per the github instructions for training a model. 

   ```bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/ml5js/training-charRNN
   $ cd training-charRNN
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python train.py --data_path /path/to/data/file.txt

   ```

   Depending on the size of your text file, you might like to set some [hyperparameters](https://github.com/ml5js/training-charRNN#hyperparameters). The size of your file will also impact the speed of the training -- my Dickinson and Eliot training took about a minute, while the original Shakespeare full text I tried using was scheduled to run for 14 hours.

   Once the training is complete, you can find the models you made in the `models/` folder. You'll need to copy the entire thing into your project so you can access them.

         

- [x] Generate predictions using the model
   
   NB: Using the ml5 library from localhost results in CORS errors. You might notice that if ou try to create a basic HTML template and then try to run your page, you will get a 404 error in the console.

   To avoid this, one solution is to run this project as a live server. I used **Live Server**, which is available as an extension with VS Code.

   In React placing the models into the `public` folder helped to overcome the same issues.

   To see your model in action, you can create a basic HTML file using this boiler plate from ml5:
      
      ```html
         <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html lang="en">
         <head>
            <title>Getting Started with ml5.js</title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@latest/dist/ml5.min.js"></script>
         </head>

         <body>
            <script>
               // Your code will go here
               // open up your console - if everything loaded properly you should see the correct version number
               console.log('ml5 version:', ml5.version);
            </script>
         </body>
         </html>
      ```
      
   The instructions on the [ml5](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/charrnn) site are excellent and clear, and I'm simply reproducing them here.

   Once you have the basic HTML in place, you can add the following to the `<script>` tags:

   ```javascript

   // Create the character level generator with a pre trained model
   const rnn = ml5.charRNN('models/bolaÃ±o/', modelLoaded);

   // When the model is loaded
   function modelLoaded() {
      console.log('Model Loaded!');
   }

   // Generate content
   rnn.generate({ seed: 'the meaning of pizza is' }, (err, results) => {
      console.log(results);
   });

   ```

   Just be sure that you correctly point  `charRNN()` to the path where you have the models.

   [TODO: Variables in rnn.generate]

   And that is it! If you open the console, you should firstly see that the Ml5 library is connected. Then you will return an object with a key `sample`, which is has been generated from your model!


- [] Create a front end to allow users to enter text,  and then have the model supply the next line

- [] Allow the user to provide a title independent of the body of the work
